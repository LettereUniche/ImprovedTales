# Improved Tales

Improved Tales is a mod for The Long Dark that aims to improve the tales by adding some quality of life improvements to the GUI and flow. 

Currently it only affects Signal Void

* Four new spawn locations for the Handheld Shortwave. These act as new starting locations for the Tale. Configurable in Mod Settings menu and is permanent on a new save.
* New narrative collectibles to accompany the new starting locations
* GUI options for disabling the Journal tab and mission popups on screen

## Note
